# Bezy Font Editor

Bezy is an open-source cross-platform font editor built with the Bevy game engine and Rust. It is designed for simplicity, customizability, user empowerment and learning, and AI-agent assisted vibe-coding.

## About Bezy

Bezy is loosely inspired by Runebender, a previous font editor built with the Druid GUI framework.

## Installation

### Prerequisites:
- Rust (1.75.0 or later)
- Cargo (included with Rust)

### Steps:

1. **Install Rust** (if you haven't already):
   ```bash
   # For macOS, Linux, or WSL
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   
   # Follow the on-screen instructions and restart your terminal
   ```
   Or visit https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install for other platforms

2. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eliheuer/bezy.git
   cd bezy
   ```

3. **Build and run**:
   ```bash
   cargo run -- --load-ufo assets/fonts/bezy-grotesk-regular.ufo --test-unicode 0061
   ```

## Using Bezy

### Basic Usage

Simply running `cargo run` will start Bezy with a default empty state. The UI includes:

- Edit mode toolbar (top left): Select, Pen, Hyper, Knife, Pan, Measure, Primitives, and Text tools
- Main editing area (center): Where font glyphs are displayed and edited
- Debug information (bottom): Font metrics and other details

### Command Line Arguments

Bezy supports several command line arguments to customize its behavior:

#### Loading a UFO Font File

```bash
cargo run -- --load-ufo <PATH_TO_UFO>
```

Example:
```bash
cargo run -- --load-ufo assets/fonts/bezy-grotesk-regular.ufo
```

#### Testing with Specific Unicode Characters

To test with a specific Unicode character:

```bash
cargo run -- --test-unicode <HEXADECIMAL_CODEPOINT>
```

Example (displays lowercase 'a'):
```bash
cargo run -- --test-unicode 0061
```

#### Combining Arguments

You can combine multiple arguments:

```bash
cargo run -- --load-ufo assets/fonts/bezy-grotesk-regular.ufo --test-unicode 0061
```

This loads the Bezy Grotesk font and displays the lowercase 'a' character.

#### Debug Mode

Enable additional debug information:

```bash
cargo run -- --debug
```

You can also control the logging verbosity using the `--log-level` option:

```bash
cargo run -- --log-level debug    # Show debug logs
cargo run -- --log-level info     # Show only info logs (default)
cargo run -- --log-level warn     # Show only warnings and errors
```

This is particularly useful when debugging font metrics and other technical details.

### The Bezy Grotesk Test Font

Bezy comes with a test font called "Bezy Grotesk" located in the `assets/fonts` directory. This is a UFO font format file that you can use to explore the editor's capabilities.

#### Key Features of Bezy Grotesk:
- Basic Latin characters
- Numbers and punctuation
- Special characters for the editor's UI
- Arabic script characters

To explore the font's structure, you can examine the UFO directory:
```
assets/fonts/bezy-grotesk-regular.ufo/
```

## Edit Modes

Bezy offers several edit modes accessible from the toolbar:

- **Select**: Select and manipulate points and paths
- **Pen**: Draw BÃ©zier curves
- **Hyper**: Advanced curve editing tool
- **Knife**: Cut existing paths
- **Pan**: Navigate the viewport
- **Measure**: Measure distances and angles
- **Primitives**: Create basic shapes
- **Text**: Add and edit text annotations

## Developing with Bezy

If you're new to Rust and want to contribute to Bezy:

1. Familiarize yourself with Bevy (the game engine): https://bevyengine.org/
2. Learn about the UFO font format: https://unifiedfontobject.org/
3. Read through the codebase, starting with `src/lib.rs` and `src/app.rs`
4. Try making small modifications to understand how things work
