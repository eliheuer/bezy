# AI CONTEXT --------------------------------------------------
This project is a Font Editor writen in Rust.

It uses the bevy game engine:
https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy

It is loosly based on a previous font editor in Rust called Runebender:
https://github.com/linebender/runebender

And takes some design inspiration from proprietary font editors RoboFont and Glyphs.

It is intended to be a cross-platform aplication, with Linux and macSupport, and will eventually be released on the Steamdeck as a user friendly aplication.
