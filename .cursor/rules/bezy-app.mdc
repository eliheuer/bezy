# Bezy Rules

## Overview

Bezy is a font editing application writen in Rust and Bevy.

It is designed to have a simple readable codebase, that junior programmers, type designers, frontend engineers, and LLMs can easily understand and work with.

It is a loose port of a previous font editor called Runebender, the major difference being that Runbender uses the Druid GUI framework and Bezy uses the Bevy ECS game engine.

Besy is designed to feel like a video game, it should be fast, fun, and engaging to use, like being immersed in a uniqe world.

I am porting code from Runbender to Bezy, that means I am porting from Druid to Bevy. The Runebender and Bevy repos are in the ai_context directory for refrance when porting.
